# Code converter
This advanced code converter 
translates Python to Shell.
It is capable of handling most translations.
Please note that this translates from
Python to Shell, and does not support
Shell to Python translations.

### Example input (in Python)

```python
# Greet a user multiple times
name = input("Enter your name: ")
count = 3

for i in range(count):
    print("Hello", name, i)

if name == "Alice":
    print("Welcome back!")
elif name == "Bob":
    print("Hey Bob!")
else:
    print("Who are you?")
```

### Example output (in Shell)

```bash
# Greet a user multiple times
read -p "Enter your name: " name
count=3

for i in $(seq 0 $((count - 1))); do
  echo "Hello $name $i"
done

if [ "$name" = "Alice" ]; then
  echo "Welcome back!"
elif [ "$name" = "Bob" ]; then
  echo "Hey Bob!"
else
  echo "Who are you?"
fi
```
#### Using the translator is easy and fun. Simply copy and paste Translator.py into a Python file,
